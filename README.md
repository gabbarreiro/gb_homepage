# Why?
When I was very young (7-9 years old) my father helped me create a personal blog and bought a domain for me (gabrielbarreiro.com). He made it using WordPress. I used to post some random and weird things of my daily routine (like school) and probably no one ever read it.

I grew older. I'm not a software engineer, but I do know to create basic stuff (thanks to the influence of my father and my love for data science). I have a cool domain. Why not create something to show the world some of my stuff?

That's the reason behind this project: I want to have a small space to share some texts and resources I find useful about things I like or believe is important. Also, there is a little bio there.
